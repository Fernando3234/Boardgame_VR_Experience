# Boardgame_VR_Experience
Intro/Goal - 
In this exciting virtual reality board game, players take turns participating in events or mini-games as they progress through the board. Each round offers different challenges and events, and players move forward based on their performance in each event. In addition to those events players will get status cards that can be used to give themselves a advantage in and out of the events or give someone else a disadvantage. The ultimate goal is to be the first player to reach the end of the board and claim victory. Immerse yourself in a virtual world and experience the thrill of competition with friends and family in this unique and entertaining board game.

This project was motivated by a Independent Research Study course from Le Moyne College.
